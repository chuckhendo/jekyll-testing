## About

Harrison joined the Chernoff Newman team after living in the corporate design world in the healthcare and tourism industries. His creative work has been published in the prestigious HOW magazine and he has won numerous regional and national awards. Prior to joining agency life, he also spent time honing his interactive design skills at a local web company. At the agency, Harrison is adept at creating and revamping brands, as is noted in his recent work for The COMET, the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, South  Lake Dental and Palmetto Health.

Design is not Harrison’s only love. You may find him concepting the next great campaign from a kayak on a weekend camping trip. Or while he’s strumming the mandolin or claw-hammer banjo. Or he could be creating the next masterpiece to hang on his own wall. Yes, kids, art school can pay off. As a graduate of the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, he brings creativity to work with him every day.

Harrison is a member of AAF of the Midlands and AIGA, the professional association for design
