Branding an advertising agency is something every designer has on their wish list. I got the chance to rebrand Chernoff Newman in 2013. It was a very long and strategic process that consumed most of my nights and weekends. What we ended up with is a very direct and streamlined approach to content and aesthetic that demonstrates what we do, how we do it and how it impacts our clients business objectives.
