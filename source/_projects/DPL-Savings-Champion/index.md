Dayton Power & Light, an energy cooperative in Dayton, OH asked for a disruptive campaign to support their energy savings initiatives. Our idea was to make the most mondane task - changing a light bulb - as exciting as the game winning touchdown in the Super Bowl. We went totally over the top cheesy in an attempt to catch the Dayton, OH commuinties attention and pursuade them to buy CFL light bulbs. We cast actors from NYC and shot in Washington, DC for 10 days. Month over month, traffic to rebates web pages increased 89% and lighting rebates traffic jumped 182%.
